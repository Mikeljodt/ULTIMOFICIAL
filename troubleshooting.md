## Error Summary

    Based on the provided `npx run build` output, the build process failed due to TypeScript type checking errors. Specifically, there are issues related to the `SignaturePad` component and its usage within the `NewClientForm` and potentially other components.

    ## Root Cause Analysis

    The error messages indicate that the `SignaturePad` component is not correctly passing or handling the `onChange` prop. The TypeScript compiler is detecting a mismatch between the expected type of the `onChange` prop and the actual type being provided or used within the `SignaturePad` component.

    This could be due to several reasons:

    1.  **Incorrect Prop Type Definition in `SignaturePad`**: The `SignaturePad` component might have an incorrect type definition for the `onChange` prop. It might be expecting a different type of function or a function with different arguments.
    2.  **Incorrect Usage of `onChange` in Parent Components**: The `NewClientForm` (or other components using `SignaturePad`) might be passing an `onChange` function that doesn't match the expected signature of the `SignaturePad` component.
    3.  **Missing Type Definitions**: There might be missing or incorrect type definitions for the signature library or component being used within `SignaturePad`.
    4.  **Version Mismatch**: A version mismatch between the `SignaturePad` component and its dependencies (e.g., signature library, React types) could also cause type errors.

    ## Recommended Solutions

    Here are three potential solutions, prioritized by likelihood of success and ease of implementation:

    1.  **Review and Correct `SignaturePad` Prop Types**:
        *   Carefully examine the `SignaturePad` component's type definitions, especially the `onChange` prop.
        *   Ensure that the `onChange` prop is correctly typed as a function that accepts the appropriate arguments (e.g., the signature data as a string).
        *   Verify that the `SignaturePad` component is actually calling the `onChange` function with the correct arguments when the signature changes.

        **Implementation Steps:**

        *   Open the `SignaturePad` component file.
        *   Inspect the type definitions for the props.
        *   Correct the `onChange` prop type if it's incorrect.
        *   Verify the `onChange` function call within the component.

    2.  **Ensure Correct `onChange` Usage in Parent Components**:
        *   Check how the `onChange` prop is being used in the `NewClientForm` and other components that use `SignaturePad`.
        *   Make sure that the function being passed as the `onChange` prop matches the expected signature of the `SignaturePad` component's `onChange` prop.
        *   Ensure that the function correctly handles the signature data being passed from the `SignaturePad` component.

        **Implementation Steps:**

        *   Open the `NewClientForm` component file.
        *   Inspect how the `onChange` prop is being passed to the `SignaturePad` component.
        *   Ensure that the function being passed matches the expected type.
        *   Verify that the function correctly handles the signature data.

    3.  **Update Dependencies and Type Definitions**:
        *   Update the dependencies related to the `SignaturePad` component, including the signature library and React types.
        *   Ensure that you have the latest type definitions for these dependencies.
        *   This can help resolve version mismatches or missing type definitions that might be causing the type errors.

        **Implementation Steps:**

        *   Update the relevant dependencies in `package.json`.
        *   Run `npm install` to install the updated dependencies.
        *   Check if the type errors are resolved.
    4. **Provide Signature Pad Component Code**
        *   If the above steps don't work, please provide the code for the `SignaturePad` component so I can analyze it directly.
